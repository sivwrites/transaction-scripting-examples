# ThousandEyes - API Transaction Examples
The following .js files are javascript synthetic transaction examples for testing various REST API endpoints. Each of the .js files listed here represent a complete transaction test and can be used as a standalone API. 

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or just download/copy an individual .js transaction script file. 
2. Using ThousandEyes, [create a new application synthetic transaction test](https://www.thousandeyes.com/resources/getting-started-with-transactions-tutorial).
3. Paste the contents of .js transaction script file (or select `Import from JS File`) into ThousandEyes
4. Change and save your test settings. Starting with 3-5 agents, perform testing in 10-minute intervals with 1 minute of rest. 
5. Create your credentials (if you don't have them already).
6. To use your credentials in the transaction script, open the <b>Transaciton test</b>, click the credentials button, and enter your credentials. Ensure you use the same credentials throughout the process.
