2. In ThousandEyes [create a new application synthetic transaction test](https://www.thousandeyes.com/resources/getting-started-with-transactions-tutorial).
3. Paste in the contents of .js transaction script file (or select `Import from JS File`)
4. Set any other test settings and save the test. Recommended to start with 3-5 agents, Round Robin testing with 10/1 minute test intervals.
